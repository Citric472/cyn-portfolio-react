        Hi, I'm Cynthia Langat, a passionate and results-driven full-stack developer with a strong background in web development. I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive applications using a variety of technologies.

      <p>
        With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient code. My journey in the world of programming started with a deep curiosity about how technology works, and that curiosity has evolved into a fulfilling career.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the front-end, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with hands-on experience in popular libraries and frameworks like React. I prioritize creating user-friendly interfaces that provide seamless and enjoyable experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the back-end, I have expertise in server-side development using technologies such as Node.js and Express. I'm experienced in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, managing databases, and ensuring the security and scalability of web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I am a problem solver and a quick learner, always eager to stay updated on the latest industry trends and technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet both user and business needs.
